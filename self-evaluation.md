# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
- The each method can be useful in situations where you need to print each element in an array on its own, if you need to print elements which meet a certain criteria or if you need to make changes to each individual element. .each makes all of these situations much faster.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
- There are so many useful methods which can be applied in each iterations. I would like to do more research on my own to find how these can be applied.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
- I attempted to find a solution by myself, remembering what I have learned thus far in the conditional, arrays and iteration readings and assignments. I was prepared to look up the methods if needbe, but I remembered all of them.
